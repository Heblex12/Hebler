            <h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
            <p>Before taking this class my knowledge of HTML & CSS was very little. And my knowledge of Javascript was basically nothing, but through this class I learned a lot about HTML and CSS. I do feel that I need a lot to learn about Javascript because I still struggle with it. </p>
            <h3>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h3>
            <p>I use a basic template from youtube, but I change everything to how I wanted my portfolio to look like. So in a sense I basically started from scratch and this allowed me to know how everything I put in my portfolio worked. </p>
            <h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h3>
            <p>The most challenging part of my portfolio was making the contact page to work like it was supposed to. The reason I say this is because I focus on making it look really nice with the css and then I focus on making it work with the Javascript, but it wasnâ€™t working. So I had to re-do it and focus more on making it work then focus on the way it looks in my portfolio. </p>
            <h3>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
            <p>I would recommend designing their portfolio before they actually start coding it because that will make the process of creating your portfolio a lot easier and faster. Also to sign for something like Codecademy so that you practice your coding and also learn from them as well. Codecademy is a great resource and it has a lot of different languages you can learn and a lot of great content.</p>
